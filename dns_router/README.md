# MyDig - Custom DNS Resolver

This is a simple DNS resolver created in python to iteratively resolve the given domain name.
The objective is to resolve the DNS name without relying on APIs from libraries that offer a one-call solution for domain resolution.


## Installation 

To install the required external library before running the program, use the following command:

```
pip install dns python
```

OR you can use the requirements.txt file to install necessary libraries.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Program
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed in your machine. 
2. Install required library following the external library. 
3. Run mydig.py program using the following command 

```
python mydig.py
```
4. When prompted, enter the domain that you wish to resolve and press Enter. The program would give you the output of the resolved answer.

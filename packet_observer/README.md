# Packet Observer

This Rust program analyzes a given pcap file to observe TCP flows initiated by a sender with a specific IP address. It calculates various metrics, such as throughput, congestion window (CWND) estimations, and the number of retransmissions due to triple duplicate ACKs and timeouts.
